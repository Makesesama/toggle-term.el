* Toggle Term

toggle-term.el is an Emacs package inspired by [[https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim][toggleterm.nvim]],
allowing you to spawn a persistent terminal or shell at the
bottom of the frame and switch between them when needed.

** Usage
toggle-term.el provides two main functions, =toggle-term-toggle= and =toggle-term-find=.
The former toggles the last-used spawned toggle-term, the latter allows you to switch
to other spawned toggle-terms, making it the last-used, or by spawning a new one.

If you want to have a present toggle-term for startup, you can add the following line to your init file
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq toggle-term-last-used '("init-toggle" . term))
#+end_src
This will ensure the first invocation of =toggle-term-toggle= spawns a =term= toggle,
with the name of *"init-toggle"*, instead of prompting the user for both a name and type.
