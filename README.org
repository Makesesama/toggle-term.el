* Toggle Term

Toggle term is inspired by [[https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim][toggleterm.nvim]], it allows you spawn a persistent terminal or shell 
at the bottom of the window, and swtich between them when needed.

** Usage
=Toggle-term= provides two main functions, =toggle-term-toggle= and =toggle-term-find=
The former toggles the last-used spawned toggle-term, the ladder allows you to swtich 
to other spawned toggle-terms, making it the last-used, or spawn a new one.

If you want to have a present toggle-term for startup, you can add the follinwg to your config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq toggle-term-last-used '("init-toggle" . term))
#+end_src
This will ensure the first ivocation of =toggle-term-toggle= spawnes a =term= toggle, with the name of *"init-toggle"*, instead of prompting 
the user for both name and type.
